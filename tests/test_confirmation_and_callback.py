"""What counts as a yes, and asking when to call back.

Both taken from real transcripts. In one, the agent asked "क्या आप इसके लिए
open हैं?", the customer said "ठीक है." -- and the agent treated that as
agreement. In the other the customer said "Hello." (they could not hear) and
the agent closed the call as a win. Neither call ever asked when to call back,
and both signed off promising a call "कल" that nobody had agreed to.

These are prompt rules, so these tests pin the rules rather than the model's
behaviour. What the model does with them only a live batch can say.
